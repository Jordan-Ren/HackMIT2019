This was the project Alex Ellison, David He, Tony Sancho, and I created called FREE (Food Redistribution Effort for Everyone).

I worked mostly on SSMS, Microsoft Azure Portal, files within HackMIT2019/Food Locator/templates/static/js/components/ and in 
HackMIT2019/Food Locator/run.py

Resources used for the project: Python, JavaScript, React, HTML5, SQL, CSS, Flask, Axios, Pyodbc, Google Maps API.
